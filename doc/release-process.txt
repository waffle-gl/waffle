Updating website
================

Checkout the `website` branch. (This requires git-lfs.)

Add new release files under the files directory. Update man html files
under the man directory. Push the website branch. This will *not*
trigger a website rebuild.

On the `master` branch, update the www/releases.html file. Push the
branch, triggering a website rebuild. The website rebuild will use the
`website` branch, which is why the `website` branch should be pushed
first.
