Waffle 1.1.0 - 15 Oct 2012
==========================

Waffle 1.1.0 is now available. Downloads and documentation are available at
    https://waffle.freedesktop.org/releases.html#1.1.0

Waffle is a cross-platform library that allows one to defer selection of GL
API and of window system until runtime. For example, on Linux, Waffle enables
an application to select X11/EGL with an OpenGL 3.3 core profile, Wayland with
OpenGL ES2, and other window system / API combinations.

The API and ABI of waffle 1.1 is backwards compatible with waffle 1.0.


New Features since 1.0
----------------------

- Support for a new Linux platform, EGL with GBM. When using GBM, OpenGL applications
  do not require a running display manager.

- Experimental support for Android.

- manpages. The entirety of waffle's public API is now documented in manpages.
  To build and install them, run CMake with `-Dwaffle_build_manpages=1`. (See
  the README for build requirements).
