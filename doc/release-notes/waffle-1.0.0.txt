Waffle 1.0.0 - 22 Aug 2012
==========================

Waffle 1.0.0 is now available. Downloads and documentation are available at
    https://waffle.freedesktop.org/releases.html#1.0.0

Waffle is a cross-platform library that allows one to defer selection of GL
API and of window system until runtime. For example, on Linux, Waffle enables
an application to select X11/EGL with an OpenGL 3.3 core profile, Wayland with
OpenGL ES2, and other window system / API combinations.


API/ABI Stability
-----------------
Until version 1.0, Waffle's API was rapidly evolving and unstable.  Version
1.0 marks a stability milestone: all future 1.x releases will be API and ABI
compatibile with previous 1.x releases.

(Note that waffle-1.0 is not backwards compatible with waffle-0.3).


New Features since 0.3
----------------------
- Ability to obtain the underlying native objects of each waffle object with
  the waffle_${object}_get_native methods. This feature allows users to
  implement interactions with the native objects, such as keyboard input, that
  lie outside Waffle's scope.
