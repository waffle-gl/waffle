The manpages have finally been published online
at https://waffle.freedesktop.org/man/index.html.

Waffle is a cross-platform library that allows one to defer selection of GL
API and of window system until runtime. For example, on Linux, Waffle enables
an application to select X11/EGL with an OpenGL 3.3 core profile, Wayland with
OpenGL ES2, and other window system / API combinations.

The ABI of waffle 1.2 is backwards compatible with waffle 1.0.


Major New Features since 1.1
----------------------------

- Support for EGL_KHR_create_context, which enables selecting the context
  version and profile on EGL.

- Support for OpenGL ES3 on GLX and EGL platforms.

- Support for OpenGL ES1 on GLX.


Minor New Features since 1.1
----------------------------

- html manpages: To build html manpages, set the new build option
  -Dwaffle_build_htmldocs=1. (See README for build requirements).

- Added a CMake "find" module, FindWaffle.cmake, for use on platforms such as
  Android that lack pkg-config.
